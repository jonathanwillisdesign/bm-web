## Changing behaviour for a changing world

With climate change driving rising seas and historic rainfall, one in four UK homes now faces flood risk. But expensive climate adaptation can feel distant or abstract. We partnered with Resilico to bring clarity and action to residents and businesses, creating a trusted platform to make informed choices—and make it ready for climate-related emergencies.

## Closing the gap between fear and action

Our research revealed the core tension: individuals don't know where to begin, and professionals were hampered by disconnected systems and data silos. Resilico bridges that gap with a human-centred ecosystem designed to make flood preparedness easy and effective.

## A connected toolkit for flood resilience

We designed Res+ (Resilient Plus) to be more than just a tool—it's a digital ecosystem. Offering verified info and personalised action plans, it reaches builders, landlords and professionals, and individuals. This connected landscape is a dashboard for local leaders to monitor risk and track climate effectiveness. Together, this connected approach improves flood readiness at every level.
