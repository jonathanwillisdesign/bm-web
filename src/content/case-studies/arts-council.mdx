## Reimagining digital access to the arts

The Arts Council Ireland approached us to create a bold ecosystem to replace five key experiences with a single world class web platform. Our mission was to make it easier for the public to discover art, to design a vibrant, welcoming presence that brings the arts to the public sphere, whether you're looking for nearby events or searching for a venue for your next event. Secondly, we wanted to vastly improve the usability of the largest arts and culture database in Ireland with 150k entries.

## Designing to increase engagement with the arts

The previous version made it difficult for people to find what they were looking for. We targeted audiences new and experienced. Information led all of our decisions, asking what they need and how they'll discover what they're looking for. In a market so saturated, we made it easy to discover what's out there.

## Shaping the arts to life

When creating arts an established brand identity, we championed a back-and-forth colour system. Our biggest consideration was giving administrators control of the platform, whilst still the arts and culture audience liked the freshly felt presented. The images and platform emerged from the design system and had a character of its own and they bring energy across the platform.

## Accessible by design, creative by nature.

Working closely with internal teams, we designed a flexible structure and evolved the Arts Council's identity into a coherent style that scaled from email promotions to large-scale posters. We developed new guidelines and tools to enable easy adoption across all brand touchpoints. The result? A flexible system that empowers every communications channel to speak with a single distinctive experience.

## A more successful, streamlined platform

We addressed governance, natural internet spam in event content systems, and introduced a complete design. We're proud to witness the launch evolving the way audiences experience. We're proud to launch our most excellent website, and the Arts Council Ireland is even proud of how much work we've done.
