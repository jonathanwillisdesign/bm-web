## Reimagining digital access to the arts

The Arts Council's expansive vision is to ensure that everyone in Ireland has the opportunity to create, engage with, and participate in the arts. Big Motive worked closely with the organisation to design a vibrant, welcoming website that brings the arts to the public online, whether you're looking for nearby events or searching for funding. Developed in collaboration with our long-time development partner Wibble, the platform reflects a co-design approach rooted in accessibility, creativity, and inclusion.

## Designing to increase engagement with the arts

The previous version made it difficult for people to find what they were looking for. We began with in-depth user and stakeholder interviews, as well as accessibility audits. The insights gathered from the research phase inspired our design work and shaped everything that followed.

## Bringing the arts to life

While working with an established brand identity, we reinvigorated a bold, energetic colour palette, developing dynamic geometric elements and patterns that elegantly helped organise the site and express the brand's full potential. The shapes and patterns emerged from the square logo, and built a cohesive visual language that brings energy across every page in celebration of Ireland's rich arts culture.

## Accessible by design, creative by nature.

Working closely with internal teams, we co-designed a flexible structure and evolved the Arts Council's identity into a digital-first design system. Every interaction was designed to be intuitive, visually expressive, and accessible (WCAG 2.2 AA-compliant). Modular prototypes were tested across devices, languages, and digital confidence levels to ensure a vibrant and fully inclusive experience.

## Embedding change through capability building.

We embedded governance, trained internal teams in smart content practices, and introduced a scalable design system to ensure long-term sustainability. The result is a flexible platform that reflects the ambitions of Ireland's arts community, and meets the needs of everyone it serves.
